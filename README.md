Welcome to the official starter kit for Turborepo, the high-speed monorepo management tool that's about to turbocharge
your development process!

## üåü Getting Started is a Breeze!

### Ready to hit the ground running? Fire up your terminal and let's get those engines revving üí•

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```
#### When prompted about which directory to select for creating the turbo app; follow through with the default suggestion (root directory):
```sh
>>> Welcome to Turborepo! Let us get you set up with a new codebase.

? Where would you like to create your turborepo? (./my-turborepo) <== 
```
#### Select _pnpm workspaces_ as your default package manager:

```sh
 Which package manager do you want to use? 
  npm workspaces 
‚ùØ pnpm workspaces 
  yarn workspaces 
  - bun workspaces (beta) (not installed)
```

_(assuming all the preceeding documented steps were followed through successfully)_ <br/>
#### Finally your terminal logs should look like so: 

```sh
Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.

>>> Success! Created a new Turborepo at "my-turborepo".
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  pnpm run build
     Build all apps and packages

  pnpm run dev
     Develop all apps and packages

  pnpm run lint
     Lint all apps and packages

Turborepo will cache locally by default. For an additional
speed boost, enable Remote Caching with Vercel by
entering the following command:

  pnpm dlx turbo login

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-turborepo
  pnpm dlx turbo login

```
 **It is _not_ required to follow up with the preceeding log**

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in the Box?

Dive into a world of efficiency with these pre-configured goodies:

### üåê Apps and Packages Galore!

- `app`: a sleek [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app for your web app.
- `contacts-dashboard-app`: a sleek [React](https://react.dev/) contact management app that uses browser's storage to save data.
- `dynamic-graph`: a modern and responsive [React](https://react.dev/) data visualizer via a graph; that uses browser's storage to save the user's search history and sharable results via links.
- `ui`: a shared React component library powering all the apps.
- `tailwind-config`: a shared [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) configuration for consistent styling across
  apps and libraries.
- `eslint-config-custom`: Keep your code clean with custom `eslint` configurations, including `eslint-config-next`
  and `eslint-config-prettier`.
- `tsconfig`: Centralized `tsconfig.json`s for consistent TypeScript configurations across the monorepo.

Psst... TypeScript is our language of choice here for that extra type safety!

### üîß Handy Utilities at Your Fingertips

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For ironclad type checking.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): To keep your code squeaky clean.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Because who doesn't love beautifully formatted code?

### üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

To construct all apps and packages in one fell swoop:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### üé® Develop with Joy

Kickstart your development environment with:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

### ‚ö° Remote Caching for Lightning-Fast Builds

Leverage [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across
machines. Perfect for team collaborations and CI/CD pipelines.

Initially set to local cache, you can switch to Remote Caching with a Vercel account:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

Authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview),
then:

```
npx turbo link
```
